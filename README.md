# VOD-Reviewer
An application to review VODS and add comments at timestamps.

To run, install VLC and run "VOD Reviewer.exe".

For python code, for it to run, edit "App.py" "dir_path(p)", edit "sys.executable" and replace it to "\__\__file____".
This is because, when compiling, sys.executable points to the file, but when running the program in python, sys.executable points to python and \__\__file____ points to the file.
